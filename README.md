# Comparison-of-GPU-CUDA-and-OpenCL-Based-on-Efficiency-by-Experimentation

GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) has an extraordinary
effect in the computing field. To improve the computing
systems performance, developments have been taking place to
utilize the equal processing design of GPU. Then again, to lessen
the development time, there are two programming models in
GPU: OpenCL (Open Computing Language) and CUDA (Compute
Unified Device Architecture)[10].Both offer two distinct
interfaces for programming GPUs. CUDA is a parallel computer
architecture developed by NVIDIA, which includes Runtime API
and Driver APII. OpenCL is an open standard that can be
utilized to program CPUs, GPUs, and different gadgets from
various sellers, while CUDA is explicit to NVIDIA GPUs. Matrix
computation like matrix multiplication is the basis for scientific
computation. Computing matrix multiplication on GPU based
CUDA and OpenCL accelerates the speed of computation as
it takes the advantage of these platforms. In this project, we
compare the difference between GPU CUDA and OpenCL on
different metrics like processing speeds for different problem
sizes, data transfer time ratio, relative difference in running time
on both GPU CUDA and OpenCL by implementing the classic
example of matrix computation based matrix multiplication
and compare the results obtained with the results found while
carrying out the literature survey.
